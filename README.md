# CodeTech_ML_Projects
This repository contains two ML projects. One is sentimental Analysis on movies reviews and the other is Faster Credit Card Fraud Detection using Snap ML. 
# SENTIMENTAL ANALYSIS ON MOVIE REVIEWS
I developed a sentiment analysis model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. IMDb Movie Reviews dataset is used for training and testing.After pre-processing the dataset by removing stop words, a stemming technique was applied to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. Naive Bayes Algorithm is used for Training the data. In naive bayes MultinomialNB gave accuracy of 84%.  The results of this analysis demonstrated the effectiveness of the model in accurately classifying movie reviews and provided valuable insights into the current state of public opinion on films.

# Faster Credit Card Fraud Detection using Snap ML
Develop a fraud detection model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset includes information about transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. I used the trained model to assess if a credit card transaction is legitimate or not. I used Snap ML which has a high-performance IBM library for ML modeling. It provides highly-efficient CPU/GPU implementations of linear models and tree-based models. Snap ML not only accelerates ML algorithms through system awareness, but it also offers novel ML algorithms with best-in-class accuracy. Support Vector Machine algorithm is used for detecting fraud Credit card transaction it showed accuracy of 96%.Credit Card fraud detection involves identifying and preventing unauthorised use of your Credit Card .
